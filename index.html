          <h1>GREETINGS</h1>
          <p>
            My name is Luca Leyva.<br>
            I’m a full-stack software developer, agile/leadership coach, and a person passionate about helping make the world a more equitable and kinder place.
          </p>
          <h1>MY STORY</h1>
          <p>I enjoy helping people and solving problems. This led me to enlist in the military after graduating high school. I spent nearly a decade working with some of our nation’s best.</p>
          <p> After leaving the military, a friend of mine asked me if I ever thought about a career in tech. I hadn’t as I felt I lacked the skills needed to succeed. My friend assured me that what was really needed were the leadership, collaboration, communication, and strategic thinking skills I learned while in the military.</p>
          <p>So, I got a job as a project manager except it was a traditional role. I was brought in to help the teamwork in a more collaborative and iterative fashion, and to help them become more efficient as a team.</p>
          <p>This led me to learn about agile, scrum, kanban, systems thinking, lean, data storytelling, etc.</p>
          <p>What I learned was there was a lot of similarity between agile/lean ways of doing things and what we did in the military: iterative planning and decision making; simple, clear, concise communication; emphasis on teamwork and ownership; and continuous improvement (e.g. Retrospectives are called After Action Reviews are standard practice, first introduced in the mid-1970s.)</p>
          <p>After working as a consultant for a few years, I moved to Silicon Valley and joined an EdTech startup. I learned a ton there about working with already high-performing teams and helping them get to the next level.</p>
