          <h1>GREETINGS</h1>
          <p>
            My name is Luca Leyva&period;<br>
            I&apos;m a full-stack software developer&comma; agile&sol;leadership coach&comma; and a person passionate about helping make the world a more equitable and kinder place&period;
          </p>
          <h1>MY STORY</h1>
          <p>I enjoy helping people and solving problems&period; This led me to enlist in the military after graduating high school&period; I spent nearly a decade working with some of our nation&apos;s best&period;</p>
          <p> After leaving the military&comma; a friend of mine asked me if I ever thought about a career in tech&period; I hadn&apos;t as I felt I lacked the skills needed to succeed&period; My friend assured me that what was really needed were the leadership&comma; collaboration&comma; communication&comma; and strategic thinking skills I learned while in the military&period;</p>
          <p>So&comma; I got a job as a project manager except it was a traditional role&period; I was brought in to help the teamwork in a more collaborative and iterative fashion&comma; and to help them become more efficient as a team&period;</p>
          <p>This led me to learn about agile&comma; scrum&comma; kanban&comma; systems thinking&comma; lean&comma; data storytelling&comma; etc.</p>
          <p>What I learned was there was a lot of similarity between agile&sol;lean ways of doing things and what we did in the military&colon; iterative planning and decision making&semi; simple&comma; clear&comma; concise communication&semi; emphasis on teamwork and ownership&semi; and continuous improvement &lpar;e&period;g&period; Retrospectives are called After Action Reviews are standard practice&comma; first introduced in the mid&hyphen;1970s&period;&rpar;</p>
          <p>After working as a consultant for a few years&comma; I moved to Silicon Valley and joined an EdTech startup&period; I learned a ton there about working with already high&hyphen;performing teams and helping them get to the next level&period;</p>
          <p>In 2017&comma; I joined Spotify as an agile coach&period; I got to learn and work with some of the best coaches and teams I&apos;ve ever encountered&period; It was a great place to experiment&comma; learn&comma; and grow&period;</p>
          <p>After 4 years&comma; I came to a crossroads about where to take my career&period; I decided I wanted to be truly involved in creating the product&comma; so I enrolled in a full-stack software developer program&period;</p>
          <p>Here I have been learning everything from &quot;What is the internet?&quot; to creating a working &quot;Rock&comma; Paper&comma; Scissors&comma; Lizard&comma; Spock&quot; game to creating databases&period;</p>
          <p>I look forward to completing this program and taking these skills to help teams and organizations achieve their goals&period;</p>
