    <h2>
        MY STORY
    </h2>
    <p>
        I enjoy helping people and solving problems. This led me to enlist in the military after graduating high school. I spent nearly a decade working with some of our nation’s best.
    </p>
    <p>
        After leaving the military, a friend of mine asked me if I ever thought about a career in tech. I hadn’t as I felt I lacked the skills needed to succeed. My friend assured me that what was really needed were the leadership, collaboration, communication, and strategic thinking skills I learned while in the military.
    </p>
    <p>
        So, I got a job as a project manager except it was a traditional role. I was brought in to help the teamwork in a more collaborative and iterative fashion, and to help them become more efficient as a team.
    </p>
    <p>
        This led me to learn about agile, scrum, kanban, systems thinking, lean, data storytelling, etc.
    </p>
    <p>
        What I learned was there was a lot of similarity between agile/lean ways of doing things and what we did in the military: iterative planning and decision making; simple, clear, concise communication; emphasis on teamwork and ownership; and continuous improvement (e.g. Retrospectives are called After Action Reviews are standard practice, first introduced in the mid-1970s.)
    </p>
    <p>
        After working as a consultant for a few years, I moved to Silicon Valley and joined an EdTech startup. I learned a ton there about working with already high-performing teams and helping them get to the next level.
    </p>
    <p>
        In 2017, I joined Spotify as an agile coach. I got to learn and work with some of the best coaches and teams I’ve ever encountered. It was a great place to experiment, learn, and grow.
    </p>
    <p>
        After 4 years, I came to a crossroads about where to take my career. I decided I wanted to be truly involved in creating the product, so I enrolled in a full-stack software developer program.
    </p>
    <p>
        Here I have been learning everything from “What is the internet?” to creating a working “Rock, Paper, Scissors, Lizard, Spock” game to creating databases.
    </p>
    <p>
        I look forward to completing this program and taking these skills to help teams and organizations achieve their goals.
    </p>
